# UIOutline

A handy component that can be used to add outlines to your Unity UI https://youtu.be/BEh2s9NOTiE

If you want to support the development of [Pico Tanks](https://www.picotanks.com/) you can download it on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pandaarcade.picotanks) or the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/pico-tanks/id1261614771).

### What's in the project?
* A UI component(single script) that dynamically generates an outline mesh with desired dimensions and density. 
* A couple of shaders to made good use of the component. 
* An example scene with several usage examples.

This project was built using Unity 2020.3.13f1. The shaders were created with Amplify Shader Editor (ASE v1.8.8 rev 14:) plugin but you don't need it to run the project, edit or use the shaders. ASE will make understanding and editing the shader much easier. http://amplify.pt/unity/amplify-shader-editor

I hope someone appreciates the share :) Have fun!
